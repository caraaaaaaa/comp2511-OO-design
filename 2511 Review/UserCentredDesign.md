## What is UCD?
- **Specify the context of use**: Identify the people who will use the product (Persona), what they will use it for, and under what conditions they will use it. (Scenario)
- **Specify requirements** : Identify any business requirements or user goals that must be met for the product to be successful. (Use-Cases)
- **Create design solutions**: This part of the process may be done in stages, building from a rough concept to a complete design.
- **Evaluate designs**: Evaluation - ideally through usability testing with actual users - is as integral as quality testing is to good software development.

## User Centred Design
• **`Agile` Development** philosophy provides value to customers, but in order for our software to be **truly successful** in the eyes of its biggest critics, we must adopt a **`more` user-centered approach**.
- UCD can be applied to the design of anything that has a user—from mobile phones to kitchens.
- The era of feature-centric development is coming to an end. Consumers are beginning to realize that ***more features do not always mean a better product***. Quality of experience is far more likely to be a product differentiator than product features
- UCD provides a way to engineer these **quality experiences**.
